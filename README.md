# Humanoid Robotic Systems tutorials

Code for the tutorials from the course Humanoid Robotic Systems at TUM. All the tasks were completed using the [NAO Robot](https://www.softbankrobotics.com/emea/en/nao) and ROS. Tutorials 3 and 4 were an introduction to computer vision using NAO's camera and tutorials 5, 6 and 7 implemented movement and other features.
